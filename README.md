Description:
Text Replacer [0]
"Text Replacer" is a tool that lets you search any text file by a pattern 
and replace only a portion of it.

Line Sequence Checker [1]
"Line Sequence Checker" is a tool to varify the integrity of lined text. 
Usually, when you have a line numbered text that is created, reproduce or 
translated without using some easy to use software such as Excel, that 
would line numberings automatically, it is a common human error (or machine 
error) to miss or add some numbers. "Line Sequence Checker" will do just that:
it will take your search pattern in regex and check for incremental values of 
each text line in txt file of you choice.
